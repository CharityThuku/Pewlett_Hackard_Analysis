## Overview of the Project
- The overview of this project was to use ERDs and SQL to organize and query data for Bobby to present to his manager regarding the status of his employees. We use ERD to create a model of the database using the data of all employees.We use SQL to get the number of retiring employees per title and identify which of thos employees would be interested in a mentorship program.

## Purpose 
- The purpose of the project is to learn how to use ERDs to create a database design that can be used to analyze and portray relational data. We also learn to use SQL to communicate with a database then update or retrieve the data. 

## Results:
- ERD 
  - Below is the ERD wchich is used to visualize the relationship between each data sources and which information is needed from each source.

- Number of Retiring Employees by Title
  - After analyzing the data, we are able to discover that the two titles, with the largest number of employees of retirement age, were Senior Engineeer and Senior Staff respectively. As portrayed in the data below:

- From the data above, we know that a large number of senior staff is of retirement age, however the number of employees who qualify is not as large. This information can help the manager decide how to prepare for the upcoming changes within the company. 

## Summary:
 - With only five active managers for nine departments, Bobby can learn that the company is oversaturated with senior staff. This could mean that they have very loyal employees or that half of that staff may not be qualified to be in that position. While sifting through the data, we did see some employees appear twice which could be explained by the fact they possibly held more than one position within the company. This data can help the company invest more in the mentorship program in order to make up for the amount of senior staff that will be retiring soon.
